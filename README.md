It is quick and easy! We'll guide you through the process here.


## HOW DOES IT WORK?
1. Compile the library url or add jar to your project. 
      With different areas, we provide corresponding external payment system jar files. You can add as many as you want. You can also enable/disable default payment options too. You can add any payment option as they want by importing the payment system library and library adapter provided by Paymentwall to their project. If you want to use FasterPay payment option then you should add a [FasterPay dependency](https://github.com/FasterPay/fasterpay-android) to your project.  
2. User requests a purchase inside your application.
3. Paymentwall SDK initializes payment screen with 4 core payment options (Brick, MINT, Mobiamo, FasterPay) and the other is “Local Payments” option. 
4. User initiates payment in-app 
      With Brick, Mint, Mobiamo the payment process will totally be native.
      With local payments, local payment screen will be shown with payment methods corresponding to user’s current location. Here users can then select a payment option they prefer.
